    <h1>The World of Vtubers</h1>

    <!-- <p>
        A VTuber is an online entertainer who uses a virtual avatar generated using computer graphics. A digital trend that originated in Japan in the mid-2010s and, since the early 2020s, has become an international online phenomenon, a majority of VTubers are English and Japanese-speaking YouTubers or live streamers who use avatar designs. By 2020, there were more than 10,000 active VTubers.
